        <p>Drivers’ assessment and analysis of developing potential hazards require mindful attention and plan since
            human error is overwhelmingly to blame for most automobile accidents. Today’s automobile is nearly
            autonomous due to Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) and the role of driver could be taken over by
            automation, but the vehicle also requires delivering performance identical to or better than that of a human
            driver if it is to be trusted. Thus, the next generation ADAS should focus on imitating the human driver’s
            analysis and assessment of hazard perception. <br> <br>
            This workshop is focused on to provide a unique platform for contributions and discussions on challenges in
            the analysis and assessment of potential developing hazards to advance the research and development of
            hazard perception in autonomous driving. This is increasingly a prime subject in computer vision, AI, and
            robotics with application to intelligent transportation systems. Accurate detection and anticipation of
            positions, movements and actions performed by multiple road users (pedestrians, vehicles, cyclists and so
            on) is the key to address the anticipation of a developing potential hazard. This is necessary for
            empowering autonomous vehicles with the capability to support reliable and safe autonomous decision making.
            It requires solving the situation awareness by considering multi-modal data (audio, visual, depth, GPS,
            etc.) and representing road scenarios in terms of objects, actions, and scene configurations to a suitable
            decision-making strategy. As a result, this will have the advantage to allow the analysis and assessment of
            hazards involving scene objects using a theory-of-mind approach, encouraged by the behaviour of a driver’s
            mind in similar contexts.
